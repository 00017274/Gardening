this is gardening project which allows users to track their plants. they can create it by writing type, variate, date of plant and location (undersun, in pot, in garden, in office), they could edit or delete them. this project was create by using node.js. Express, and pug as view enginen. express-validator for validating inputs. Even this project doesnt represent any real app, I believe it's still useful.
